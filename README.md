# The Analysis
Each query is designed to investigate certain aspects of the data analyst job market in 2023. Here is the detail on my approach:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the top-paying jobs, I filtered out 'Data Analyst' positions by average yearly salary. I also include 'Anywhere' and 'New York, NY' for location. This query helps me find the most high paying opportunities for my personal preference in the field. 

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    company_dim.name AS company_name,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_location IN ('Anywhere','New York, NY')
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2. Top Skills For Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
With 'Data Analyst' from 'Anywhere' and 'New York, NY' selected, I navigated the skills that associate with these roles to identify what skills were needed for such high salaries.
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        company_dim.name AS company_name,
        salary_year_avg
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND job_location IN ('Anywhere','New York, NY')
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills_dim.skills
FROM 
    top_paying_jobs
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```

### 3. Most Demand Skills
Using COUNT function, I found skills that were mentioned the most for Data Analysts job postings. This query will be beneficial for seeing what the current job market needs and targeting most demanded skills for job seekers.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills_dim.skills,
    COUNT(job_postings_fact.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
GROUP BY 
    skills_dim.skills   
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### 4. Top-paying Skills
In order to get the highest paying skills, I used AVG function to find average anual salary for each kill. Also, I filtered out 25 niche skills that lead to highest income for data analysts.
```sql
SELECT 
    skills_dim.skills,
    ROUND(AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_to_skill_salary
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    skills_dim.skills   
ORDER BY
    avg_to_skill_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

### 5. The Optimal Skills
To found the intersection between most demanded and top-paying skills, I utilized CTEs. This would give job seekers directions both short and long term pursuing Data Analytics. 
```sql
WITH skills_demand AS (
    SELECT 
        skills_dim.skill_id,
        skills_dim.skills,
        COUNT(job_postings_fact.job_id) AS demand_count
    FROM 
    job_postings_fact
        INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
        INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE
        job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND job_location IN ('Anywhere','New York, NY')
        AND job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
    skills_dim.skill_id  
),
average_salary AS (
    SELECT 
        skills_dim.skill_id,
        skills_dim.skills,
        ROUND(AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_to_skill_salary
    FROM 
    job_postings_fact
        INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
        INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE
        job_postings_fact.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND job_location IN ('Anywhere','New York, NY')
        AND job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        skills_dim.skill_id  
)
SELECT
    skills_demand.skill_id,
    skills_demand.skills,
    skills_demand.demand_count,
    average_salary.avg_to_skill_salary
FROM
    skills_demand
    INNER JOIN average_salary ON skills_demand.skill_id = average_salary.skill_id
WHERE
    skills_demand.demand_count > 10
ORDER BY
    avg_to_skill_salary DESC,
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

# What I learned
üß† **Advanced SQL Techniques:**
I significantly improved my SQL skills by working with complex queries, including the use of COUNT(), AVG(), and other aggregate functions to generate meaningful insights from data. I also practiced writing nested subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to enhance the clarity and efficiency of my code.

üîó **Working with Relational Databases:**
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of JOIN operations by combining multiple tables to answer data-driven questions. I became more confident in identifying the right join types and structuring queries that reflect the relationships within the database schema.

üõ†Ô∏è **Problem Solving & Logical Thinking:**
Through hands-on challenges, I developed a sharper analytical mindset. I learned how to break down complex problems into smaller steps, identify patterns in data, and build queries that not only work‚Äîbut also scale well with larger datasets.

üìä **Data Analyst Job Market Insights:**

üíº **Roles & Seniority:**

While all roles fall under the Data Analyst umbrella, they vary significantly in seniority and scope:

- Basic roles: Data Analyst, Marketing Data Analyst, Reference Data Analyst

- Mid-senior roles: Principal Data Analyst, Associate Director - Data Insights

- Leadership: Director of Analytics, Investigations and Insights Lead

Several roles mix domain specialization (e.g., marketing, investigations, reference data) with analytics, showing that hybrid expertise is highly valued.

üí∞ **High-Paying Opportunities:**

- The top-paying role is a general Data Analyst at Mantys with a surprising $650,000 salary. This is likely an outlier or includes additional compensation (e.g., equity).

- Other high-paying roles:

Director of Analytics at Meta ‚Äì $336,500

Associate Director - Data Insights at AT&T ‚Äì $255,829.50

Two identical roles at TikTok ‚Äì $239,777.50 each

Most of these high-paying roles come with director-level or lead titles, suggesting that management experience and cross-functional leadership are strong salary drivers.

üîÅ **Notable Patterns:**

- Repeated Role Posting: TikTok‚Äôs "Investigations and Insights Lead" appears twice, possibly reflecting multiple openings or reposting for visibility.

- Location Flexibility: The highest paying jobs are mostly remote-friendly ("Anywhere"), showing that companies no longer tie high salaries to expensive locations.

- Consistent Job Type: All roles are full-time, reinforcing that high-level data analysis is seen as a core, not freelance or contract, function.

üß† **Takeaway:**

The data analyst title covers a wide range of roles, from entry-level to executive-track positions. High salaries are concentrated in leadership or specialized roles that blend analytics with strategy, business acumen, or domain knowledge. Companies increasingly offer remote work without sacrificing compensation, making the market both lucrative and flexible.
