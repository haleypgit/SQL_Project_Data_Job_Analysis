/* Analysis:
SVN tops the chart with a surprising $400K average salaryâ€”likely reflecting niche or legacy system expertise in high-level roles.

AI/ML frameworks (like DataRobot, MXNet, PyTorch, and TensorFlow) are consistently above $120K, signaling strong demand in machine learning.

DevOps tools such as Terraform, Puppet, and VMware are high-paying, showing the value of cloud infrastructure skills.

Emerging tech pays off: Skills like Solidity (blockchain) and Golang (modern systems) earn well above $150K.
